The Future We Choose presented by Jackson M Phoenix and Barney White,Lawn,ALTRD State,Friday,17:00,"ALTRD State is the final part of multi art-form project, The Future We Choose: a collaboration between artists Jackson M Phoenix and Barney White commissioned by Greenbelt Festival which aims to craft a radical new collective vision for our shared future.  The sixth element of the project, ALTRD State is a living, evolving, muti-sensory installation: an altar space that will be co-created by all who visit it.   ALTRD State is a meditation on the idea that true transformation, of the sort we need as a species and planet, begins within. That if we are to manifest a radically better future, we must start first from the space inside ourselves. As Ram Dass said, ‘the real work you have to do is in the privacy of your own heart’.  You are warmly invited to be a part of this communal artwork, this shared space of reflection, this collective (re)visioning.  You are invited to bring something to contribute to the collective altar. Something that has meaning for you, that helps you to feel connected or to move towards the sacred. A stone, a photo, a few words, a drawing, a flower, a poem, a candle…   We will also be offering Altar-ing workshops: hands-on creative workshops in which we will create contributions to grow our shared altar, whilst sharing sacred space for connection, reflection, quietness and exchange.  Our intention is that ALTRD State will become a living collective artwork which will continue beyond its first incarnation at Greenbelt Festival 2022, seeding inspiration, connection, reflection and (re)visioning as it evolves.  The ALTRD State space will also be offering contemplative readings, existential bedtime stories, meditation sessions, and creative future visioning workshops. Keep an eye on social media for up-to-date posts about what’s on in the space: Instagram @altrd.state  Initially comprising 5 multi-artform pieces, to be exhibited at Greenbelt alongside ALTRD State, The Future We Choose is a shared space for contemplation, exchange, deep listening, and collective (re)visioning. It is clear we need to rethink our direction of travel as a species - but to change direction, we must have a new destination in mind. TFWC asks the question: Forgetting what you think is possible or likely, what could a radically better future for humanity and our planet look like?",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/the-future-we-choose-presented-by-jackson-m-phoenix-and-barney-white/?back=1

I would prefer to be a poet for whom religious things mattered intensely.’  After retiring as Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge in 2020, former Archbishop Rowan Williams is now living back in his native Wales, where he is busy with writing and freelance teaching and is co-chair of the Welsh Constitutional Commission, looking at future democratic patterns in Wales.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/rowan-williams/?back=1

Giles Fraser,Glade,In Conversation With Richard Dawkins,Monday,10:45,"Richard Dawkins' work on evolutionary biology saw him voted the world’s top thinker in Prospect magazine’s poll in 2013.

One in which we explore Richard’s life, asking about his sense of ‘otherness', the human condition (of interdependence), his seemingly, strangely, almost Anglican aesthetic, his sense of awe and wonder.
