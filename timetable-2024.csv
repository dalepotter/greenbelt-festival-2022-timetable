Ariel Dempsey,Glade,Communion: Dreaming of Home,Sunday,10:00,"GATHER FROM 09.00. SERVICE STARTS AT 10.00.  If you were forced to flee your home, what would you take with you? Photographs for memories? Documents for identity? Food for sustenance?  Almost certainly you would carry with you the hope of a future home where we can all break bread together in peace.  We all dream of home — a place where we can live in peace; where we can make bread, and eat it, and share it with those we love. Many of us have homes that give us at least some of this — though home can also be a fraught place, where the sadness of the world is literally brought home to us. And for others, home is a distant dream.  This year, tens of thousands of people living in Gaza have been forced to leave their homes. Many times over. We stand with them, and with those peace-loving people in Israel who want to create a homeland they can share. We gather this year with hearts wrung out by the conflict in the Middle East.  Because of this, our Act of Communion will have a simple, stripped-down feel. We will meet like those who are still searching for a safe home. More than ever, it will be an act of participation, something we make together.  Daoud Nassar will be with us and we will break bread with the those at theTent of Nations, his family farm outside Bethlehem where their ancestral land is under threat. Bethlehem was the birthplace of Jesus. The name means ‘House of Bread’. And bread will be at the centre of our meeting.  Sometimes we make our homes very small. Sometimes we focus on home as a place of protection instead of hospitality. Jesus didn’t promise his followers a secure home at all — quite the opposite. In fact, he said: ‘Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’  What Jesus did offer was bread for today, and a vision of a heavenly home. As we share our physical homes, we work to shape the home of ourdreams: a community that will give human relationships the sturdiness that earth alone does not provide.  Our Act of Communion will be hosted by Isaac Borquaye, better known as Guvna B. Music will come from Siskin Green, a contemporary Scottish folk trio, who draw on themes of faith, feminism and justice. It will also feature Cyr wheel with Ariel Dempsey and a song from Flamy Grant.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/ariel-dempsey/?back=1

Trussell Trust,Living Room,"If You’re Not At The Table, You’re On The Menu",Saturday,12:30,"Many of our government-funded systems are failing the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.  At the same time, we are side-lining our greatest asset; local people. We have a stark choice – to keep pouring money into policies we know aren’t working, or to invest in new and better ways that really improve people’s lives. We need a radical reset: one that empowers local charities, grassroots movements and faith groups, in a more imaginative, less bureaucratic, more collaborative approach to community development. A Manifesto for Hope sets out ten tried-and-tested practical principles for how to develop joined-up, cost-effective, community-empowering work, each gleaned form the hard-won experience that has sat at the heart of Steve Chalke’s work over the last four decades.

Trussell Trust,Living Room,Laying it Out on The Table,Sunday,15:30,"In food banks and churches up and down the country people are sharing their hopes and dreams, their hardship and reality. We are collecting 100s of tablecloths to lay it out on the table for our new Government so they can see and hear how it feels at the moment for people who do not have enough money to buy the essentials we all need.  Lets join in this movement for justice by sharing our stories and sending a message to our new MPs about what we want to see change in the UK, that will end the need for food banks.  Let’s talk honestly about the things that are not working as well as the glimmers of hope we find. Research by the Trussell Trust shows us how hard it can be. Seven in 10 people visiting a food bank have a disability, 1 in 4 people visiting a food bank have not had a conversation with a friend or family member for more than a month. What’s your story? Have you tried to live on Universal Credit but found you simply did not have enough to buy the essentials we all need? Have you been involved in some kind of social action that has really made a difference?

Trussell Trust,Living Room,Tangle: Knot Our Future,Sunday,19:00,"From Beans to Policy...  3.1 million emergency food parcels were distributed by Trussell Trust food banks in the 12 months to March 2024. This is nearly double the number distributed five years ago.  It is predicted that financial hardship and food insecurity will be experienced by 14% of the population, over 11 million people, in the next year. We cannot allow these rising levels of need to continue, and we know what needs to change to help people who can’t afford the essentials.  How do we get from donating beans to changing policy?  Change is needed at many levels. We need more people to donate staple foods like tins of beans to our food banks. We also need continued design and advocacy work towards policy change, maintaining the pressure on decision makers to do better.  But between the simple gesture of a food donation and the complex reality of working for policy change, what else needs to happen?  What can you do?  Join us on Sunday evening to explore your own agency.   We are hosting a space to learn from people’s lived experience of financial hardship and food insecurity. An opportunity to grow your understanding of the tangle we’re in.   Part game and part evolving artwork, Tangle is an invitation to find new ways forward.  Working in teams, you’re invited to explore possible ways to realise food security for 11.3 million people in the UK.   You will be tasked with unpicking the knots created when individual experience and systemic barriers collide. To cocreate a future where none of us need to use emergency food to get by.  With insight and guidance from a collective of people with lived experience of financial hardship and food insecurity, what ideas might you come up with? and what might you do differently as a result?  This session, led by a collective of people with lived experience and artist Chloe Osborne, invites us to consider our next steps.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/trussell-trust/?back=1

In a highly original approach to biographical shows, Benson deals not with Williams’ career but with his character, showing him in public and private: his outrageous comedy and his introspective anguish.  Benson then weaves his own story into the mix telling how, as a thirteen-year old schoolboy, he wrote a story for a Jackanory competition. His story was chosen and read on television by Kenneth Williams – to the schoolboy’s dismay.  With no set or props, Benson’s masterful and haunting play takes you on a roller-coaster ride – here presented in a very rare, one-off performance.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/think-no-evil-of-us-presented-by-david-benson/?back=1

Each puddle holds a differing combination of sticks, rocks, fossils and water. Each puddle invites connections and stories as to our relationship with the Earth we live on and how young we are in that. The water in every puddle is approximately four and half billion years old. It has been cycling through the histories of all living things for all that time; it holds countless stories, countless memories as it falls through the skies, through the soil, through us and through everything.

Steve Chalke,Living Room,"If You’re Not At The Table, You’re On The Menu",Saturday,12:30,"Many of our government-funded systems are failing the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.  At the same time, we are side-lining our greatest asset; local people. We have a stark choice – to keep pouring money into policies we know aren’t working, or to invest in new and better ways that really improve people’s lives. We need a radical reset: one that empowers local charities, grassroots movements and faith groups, in a more imaginative, less bureaucratic, more collaborative approach to community development. A Manifesto for Hope sets out ten tried-and-tested practical principles for how to develop joined-up, cost-effective, community-empowering work, each gleaned form the hard-won experience that has sat at the heart of Steve Chalke’s work over the last four decades. It culminates in a call for a new social covenant, one that will transform the life chances of countless young people and families.  It’s time to reimagine. Lets explore practical ways that bring us off the menu and at the table.

Siskin Green,Glade,Communion: Dreaming of Home,Sunday,10:00,"GATHER FROM 09.00. SERVICE STARTS AT 10.00.  If you were forced to flee your home, what would you take with you? Photographs for memories? Documents for identity? Food for sustenance?  Almost certainly you would carry with you the hope of a future home where we can all break bread together in peace.  We all dream of home — a place where we can live in peace; where we can make bread, and eat it, and share it with those we love. Many of us have homes that give us at least some of this — though home can also be a fraught place, where the sadness of the world is literally brought home to us. And for others, home is a distant dream.  This year, tens of thousands of people living in Gaza have been forced to leave their homes. Many times over. We stand with them, and with those peace-loving people in Israel who want to create a homeland they can share. We gather this year with hearts wrung out by the conflict in the Middle East.  Because of this, our Act of Communion will have a simple, stripped-down feel. We will meet like those who are still searching for a safe home. More than ever, it will be an act of participation, something we make together.  Daoud Nassar will be with us and we will break bread with the those at theTent of Nations, his family farm outside Bethlehem where their ancestral land is under threat. Bethlehem was the birthplace of Jesus. The name means ‘House of Bread’. And bread will be at the centre of our meeting.  Sometimes we make our homes very small. Sometimes we focus on home as a place of protection instead of hospitality. Jesus didn’t promise his followers a secure home at all — quite the opposite. In fact, he said: ‘Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’  What Jesus did offer was bread for today, and a vision of a heavenly home. As we share our physical homes, we work to shape the home of ourdreams: a community that will give human relationships the sturdiness that earth alone does not provide.  Our Act of Communion will be hosted by Isaac Borquaye, better known as Guvna B. Music will come from Siskin Green, a contemporary Scottish folk trio, who draw on themes of faith, feminism and justice. It will also feature Cyr wheel with Ariel Dempsey and a song from Flamy Grant.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/siskin-green/?back=1

Melissa James,Fringe,Melissa James,Friday,19:00,"Best current British blues singer I know. – The words of BBC 6 Music's Tom Robinson who has long given a nod of approval to the work of this singer-songwriter. Melissa James is, however, much more than a blues singer. Intuition guided Melissa’s creative decision of recording her second album - “Stripped Back” - in a pared down setting. Her naked voice intimately placed against the backdrop of just the guitar played by Tom Gamble or the piano played by Arthur Lea. All this gave space for her own voice and plight to clearly emerge.   Later, rising from this understanding was the idea of Sing for Sane – a Big Sing and mental health initiative in which Melissa would extend invitations to anyone who wanted to sing with her to come and do just that. People from all walks of life would stand alongside her in public spaces, and during her concert performances, to sing on stage. Melissa captures the audience with her own set intention which is to emit love through her music. This is evident through the emotion in her voice and her songs which see rootsy folk-blues traverse jazz and gospel tones.   Fresh from a completed run of performances in Agatha Christie’s Witness for the Prosecution, Melissa performs an acoustic set at Greenbelt with Richard Bolton on guitar and Chrissy Lemonte joining her on backing vocals.  “James takes all of her musical loves – jazz, blues, soul, folk – and wraps them up into songs that achieve an astonishing array of moods and emotions.” - Jazzwise   “Melissa’s vocals are sensitive, soulful and emotional...” - Maverick",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/melissa-james/?back=1

Guvna B,Glade,Communion: Dreaming of Home,Sunday,10:00,"GATHER FROM 09.00. SERVICE STARTS AT 10.00.  If you were forced to flee your home, what would you take with you? Photographs for memories? Documents for identity? Food for sustenance?  Almost certainly you would carry with you the hope of a future home where we can all break bread together in peace.  We all dream of home — a place where we can live in peace; where we can make bread, and eat it, and share it with those we love. Many of us have homes that give us at least some of this — though home can also be a fraught place, where the sadness of the world is literally brought home to us. And for others, home is a distant dream.  This year, tens of thousands of people living in Gaza have been forced to leave their homes. Many times over. We stand with them, and with those peace-loving people in Israel who want to create a homeland they can share. We gather this year with hearts wrung out by the conflict in the Middle East.  Because of this, our Act of Communion will have a simple, stripped-down feel. We will meet like those who are still searching for a safe home. More than ever, it will be an act of participation, something we make together.  Daoud Nassar will be with us and we will break bread with the those at theTent of Nations, his family farm outside Bethlehem where their ancestral land is under threat. Bethlehem was the birthplace of Jesus. The name means ‘House of Bread’. And bread will be at the centre of our meeting.  Sometimes we make our homes very small. Sometimes we focus on home as a place of protection instead of hospitality. Jesus didn’t promise his followers a secure home at all — quite the opposite. In fact, he said: ‘Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’  What Jesus did offer was bread for today, and a vision of a heavenly home. As we share our physical homes, we work to shape the home of ourdreams: a community that will give human relationships the sturdiness that earth alone does not provide.  Our Act of Communion will be hosted by Isaac Borquaye, better known as Guvna B. Music will come from Siskin Green, a contemporary Scottish folk trio, who draw on themes of faith, feminism and justice. It will also feature Cyr wheel with Ariel Dempsey and a song from Flamy Grant.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/guvna-b/?back=1

Georgina Barney,Arts Around Site,Daily Art Walk,Sunday,13:00,"SELF-GUIDED WALKS FRI/SAT/SUN 13.00 – 17.00  From the top of the Orchard to the House. Pick up a map at the Residency or as you start the walk. Last departure 16.15.  Leave time to return by 17.00  SIGNS AND SMALL WONDERS Nessie Ramm  Toadflax, woundwort, goat’s-beard, viper’s bugloss: these centuries-old plant names evoke the richness of this once wild land. But if you’re looking for our native wildflowers these days, then turn your attention to the roadside where you will find these plants from a lost bucolic era, now thriving on roundabouts, along slip-roads, around car parks and in litter-strewn lay-bys.  SUN TEA Georgina Barney × Buccleuch  In collaboration with David Cullum, Parks and Gardens Manager at Boughton House, Georgina brings refreshment to Greenbelters en route to The House. ‘Sun Tea‘ is brewed with the Estate’s honey, which contains traces of the flora the bees feed upon across the Estate. You are invited to enjoy the fine view with a hint of wilderness!  NINE PUDDLES: STORIES FOR YOUNG HUMANS John Newling  A brand-new artwork for Greenbelt 2024. Each puddle holds a differing combination of sticks, rocks, fossils and water. Each puddle invites connections and stories as to our relationship with the Earth we live on and how young we are in that. The water in every puddle is approximately four and half billion years old. It has been cycling through the histories of all living things for all that time; it holds countless stories, countless memories as it falls through the skies, through the soil, through us and through everything.  ÉCOUTE ET RÉPÈTE Tom Hackett  1,000 repeat cast jelly forms, hand-modelled from lost jelly shoes found by Lac De St Croix, France — as a meditation on repetition and authenticity in art.  First shown at the National Shoe Collection, Northampton.  Funded by Arts Council England  MOMENTUM Susan Williams  Assembled in the garden of one of the shoe ‘Barons’ of Kettering (a town historically rooted in the shoe industry) from shoes donated by the people of Kettering and Greenbelt volunteers. The work reflects the history of the house, the town, the local people and the event. Diverse in character and heavy with personal references, the shoes fit the space and move together as one, reminiscent of marches for justice.

Georgina Barney,Arts Around Site,Exhibition: Performance Wear,Sunday,13:00,"13.00 – 17.00 PERFORMANCE WEAR  The Tapestry Suite, Boughton House. Access via the ‘Art Walk’, leaving from the top of the Orchard.  A collection of clothes, shoes and costumes (and artwork about these things) that speak about their wearers’ ideas, values and identities. The exhibition is about fitting in and standing out, being alone and being together; and about Northampton’s place in the world. It is about how we can sometimes become ourselves by performing something other than ourselves.  VESTRY Holly Slingsby  ‘Vestry‘ comprises costumes and props from the artist’s performance works of the last fifteen years. Piled up together they form a richly layered and textured array that suggests a range of guises available for a ritual celebrant or participant to inhabit.  MADE IN NORTHAMPTON Georgina Barney x Academy (Fermynwoods Contemporary Art)  Georgina has worked with students from the CE Academy from across Northamptonshire in partnership with Fermynwoods Contemporary Art to dye woollen socks using plants foraged from the estate. These are exhibited alongside shoes from Northampton, ‘the capital of shoe-making’.  THINGS TO COPE IN Kate Genever  Kate wears her capes at art events and also for social occasions. Ultimately they are protest banners, they are political, they are pleas, they make Kate feel stronger and able to continue. Her ambition is that they also make people notice, reflect and feel empowered.  PRINT Georgina Barney x Buccleuch  Georgina has dyed fabric using nettles from the Estate to fashion a cushion — an homage to the late Duke who valued nettles for their environmental benefits, instructing staff not to cut them. On the cushion sits a nineteenth century ‘lawn slipper’ from Boughton’s archive; a protective leather horseshoe which served to protect the perfectly cut formal lawns as the horse pulled an early form of the lawnmower.

Flamy Grant,Glade,Communion: Dreaming of Home,Sunday,10:00,"GATHER FROM 09.00. SERVICE STARTS AT 10.00.  If you were forced to flee your home, what would you take with you? Photographs for memories? Documents for identity? Food for sustenance?  Almost certainly you would carry with you the hope of a future home where we can all break bread together in peace.  We all dream of home — a place where we can live in peace; where we can make bread, and eat it, and share it with those we love. Many of us have homes that give us at least some of this — though home can also be a fraught place, where the sadness of the world is literally brought home to us. And for others, home is a distant dream.  This year, tens of thousands of people living in Gaza have been forced to leave their homes. Many times over. We stand with them, and with those peace-loving people in Israel who want to create a homeland they can share. We gather this year with hearts wrung out by the conflict in the Middle East.  Because of this, our Act of Communion will have a simple, stripped-down feel. We will meet like those who are still searching for a safe home. More than ever, it will be an act of participation, something we make together.  Daoud Nassar will be with us and we will break bread with the those at theTent of Nations, his family farm outside Bethlehem where their ancestral land is under threat. Bethlehem was the birthplace of Jesus. The name means ‘House of Bread’. And bread will be at the centre of our meeting.  Sometimes we make our homes very small. Sometimes we focus on home as a place of protection instead of hospitality. Jesus didn’t promise his followers a secure home at all — quite the opposite. In fact, he said: ‘Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’  What Jesus did offer was bread for today, and a vision of a heavenly home. As we share our physical homes, we work to shape the home of ourdreams: a community that will give human relationships the sturdiness that earth alone does not provide.  Our Act of Communion will be hosted by Isaac Borquaye, better known as Guvna B. Music will come from Siskin Green, a contemporary Scottish folk trio, who draw on themes of faith, feminism and justice. It will also feature Cyr wheel with Ariel Dempsey and a song from Flamy Grant.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/flamy-grant/?back=1

Daoud Nassar,Hot House,Ecological Occupation,Saturday,17:00,"One of the lesser-acknowledged impacts of occupation and colonialsation is the way in which they trample over centuries-old ways of living with and off 'the land'. Nowhere is this more evident that in Palestine, where the Israeli occupation constantly disrupts and dismantles the Palestinians' relationship with and dependence on the land for their livelihoods and sustenance – cutting off communities from their olive groves and water supplies with seemingly no regard for the ecological sustainability of their way of life. Daoud Nassar's family doggedly resist this at The Tent of Nations, their hilltop farm just outside Bethlehem.

Daoud Nassar,Glade,Communion: Dreaming of Home,Sunday,10:00,"GATHER FROM 09.00. SERVICE STARTS AT 10.00.  If you were forced to flee your home, what would you take with you? Photographs for memories? Documents for identity? Food for sustenance?  Almost certainly you would carry with you the hope of a future home where we can all break bread together in peace.  We all dream of home — a place where we can live in peace; where we can make bread, and eat it, and share it with those we love. Many of us have homes that give us at least some of this — though home can also be a fraught place, where the sadness of the world is literally brought home to us. And for others, home is a distant dream.  This year, tens of thousands of people living in Gaza have been forced to leave their homes. Many times over. We stand with them, and with those peace-loving people in Israel who want to create a homeland they can share. We gather this year with hearts wrung out by the conflict in the Middle East.  Because of this, our Act of Communion will have a simple, stripped-down feel. We will meet like those who are still searching for a safe home. More than ever, it will be an act of participation, something we make together.  Daoud Nassar will be with us and we will break bread with the those at theTent of Nations, his family farm outside Bethlehem where their ancestral land is under threat. Bethlehem was the birthplace of Jesus. The name means ‘House of Bread’. And bread will be at the centre of our meeting.  Sometimes we make our homes very small. Sometimes we focus on home as a place of protection instead of hospitality. Jesus didn’t promise his followers a secure home at all — quite the opposite. In fact, he said: ‘Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’  What Jesus did offer was bread for today, and a vision of a heavenly home. As we share our physical homes, we work to shape the home of ourdreams: a community that will give human relationships the sturdiness that earth alone does not provide.  Our Act of Communion will be hosted by Isaac Borquaye, better known as Guvna B. Music will come from Siskin Green, a contemporary Scottish folk trio, who draw on themes of faith, feminism and justice. It will also feature Cyr wheel with Ariel Dempsey and a song from Flamy Grant.",https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/artists/daoud-nassar/?back=1

Let’s talk honestly about the things that are not working as well as the glimmers of hope we find. Research by the Trussell Trust shows us how hard it can be.
